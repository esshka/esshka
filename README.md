## About Me

I am a **Principal Software Engineer and Architect** with **20+ years of professional experience** building complex systems.

My background is in **Mathematics and Computer Science**. This gives me strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and theoretical foundations of machine learning.

I value clean architecture and well-structured code. My preferred patterns include **SOLID principles**, **Event-Driven Architecture**, **CQRS**, and **asynchronous programming**. These approaches allow me to build systems that are maintainable, scalable, and easy to reason about.

I earned my **Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD)** certification in 2005. Since then, I have worked professionally with C#, .NET ecosystem, and many other technologies.

Over the years, I have built and shipped products for multiple startups. I have experience in full product lifecycle — from initial architecture to production deployment and maintenance.

My project portfolio covers many domains: **e-commerce**, **booking and ticketing systems**, **project management and issue-tracking software**, **real-time online games**, and various **real-time communication systems**. I have extensive experience with **trading platforms**, **exchange APIs**, **cryptocurrency**, and **fintech** in general.

Since 2016, I maintain a **TOP rated+** profile on Upwork with **100% Job Success Score**. My clients range from early-stage startups to established companies.
